5

1139 Ganja earthquake
September 30, 1139
Ganja, Azerbaijan
230,000–300,000[175]
7.0 Mw 
Death toll may have been a historical conflation with earthquakes on November 1137 in the Jazira plain and the 1138 Aleppo earthquake.



6

2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami
December 26, 2004
Indian Ocean, Sumatra, Indonesia
227,898
9.1–9.3
Became the deadliest tsunami on record, causing nearly 230,000 deaths from the earthquake and resulting tsunami across 14 countries.


7

1138 Aleppo earthquake
October 11, 1138
Aleppo, Syria
130,000–230,000[176]
7.1[176]
The figure of 230,000 dead is based on a historical conflation of this earthquake with earthquakes in November 1137 on the Jazira plain and on September 30, 1139 in the Azerbaijani city of Ganja. The first mention of a 230,000 death toll was by Ibn Taghribirdi in the fifteenth century.[177]

11

893 Ardabil earthquake

Ardabil, Iran

Reports probably relate to the 893 Dvin earthquake, due to misreading of the Arabic word for Dvin, 'Dabil' as 'Ardabil'.[182] This is regarded as a 'fake earthquake'.[183]

1908 Messina earthquake
